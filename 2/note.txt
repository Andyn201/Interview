			Hey $BOB,
			I saw your presentation at $CONFERENCE last year on Youtube (rr point to some work they have done).
			Great stuff; loved what you did with $FOO, in particular
			$COMMENT_PROVING_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOU'RE_TALKING_ABOUT.
			I'm also a $FOO developer. I noticed that your company is hiring
			or $ROLE. I’d love to be a part of your team. Do you have a
			few minutes to chat on Thursday about what you guys are doing?
 
			Thanks,
			Yourname

			Seen is a platform that helps software engineers find jobs at top tech companies. It's 100% free for all candidates (students) and gives you Career Coaching, Resume Review, Interview Prep and Salary Negotiation.. they charge the recruiter, so if you are a good candidate, they get you hired and they make money through the company and not you... (it's free to you).  Seen tries to find a job from their list of 10,000 companies.
